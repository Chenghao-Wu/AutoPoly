# Bead-Spring (Coarse-Grained)

`BeadSpringPolymer` builds coarse-grained bead-spring polymer models — Kremer–Grest-style chains of Lennard-Jones beads — with no SMILES and no atom typing. Use it for large systems, long chains, and polymer physics studies where chemical detail is not the point. Coordinates are generated in Python (SAW / MC); the output files are then produced through the **moltemplate backend** (the standard backend for coarse-grained cases), with a lightweight direct writer available as an alternative.

```python
from AutoPoly import System, BeadSpringPolymer, BeadType

system = System(out="cg_melt")

bsp = BeadSpringPolymer(
    name="homopolymer",
    system=system,
    n_chains=50,
    bead_types=[BeadType(name="A", mass=1.0, epsilon=1.0, sigma=1.0)],
    sequence=[("A", 100)],        # 100 beads of type A per chain
    topology="linear",
    bond_style="harmonic",
    pair_style="lj",
    generation_method="saw",
)
bsp.generate()                    # moltemplate backend (default)
# bsp.generate(backend="direct")  # lightweight alternative, no moltemplate run
```

## Building blocks

| Class | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `BeadType` | One bead species: `name`, `mass`, LJ `epsilon` and `sigma` |
| `AngleType` | Bending stiffness for a bead triplet (`k`, `theta0`) |
| `SAWConfig` | Tuning for self-avoiding-walk generation (trials, backtracking, ring closure) |
| `MCConfig` | Tuning for Monte Carlo pre-equilibration (moves, temperature, steps) |

## Sequences and topologies

The `sequence` describes one chain and accepts several forms:

```python
sequence=[("A", 100)]              # homopolymer: 100 × A
sequence=[("A", 50), ("B", 50)]    # diblock: A₅₀-b-B₅₀
sequence="AABB"                    # shorthand by bead name
sequence=["A", "A", "B", "B"]      # explicit per-bead list
```

Topologies:

- `"linear"` — chain with two free ends
- `"ring"` — cyclic chain; the generator spends extra trials closing the ring (`SAWConfig.ring_closure_trials`, `ring_closure_tolerance`)

## Architectures (graph core)

For anything beyond linear/ring, pass a `BeadArchitecture` built with the
factories in `AutoPoly.models.architectures` (a chain is an explicit graph:
nodes = beads, edges = bonds — everything else is derived):

```python
from AutoPoly.models import architectures as arch

bsp = BeadSpringPolymer(
    name="comb",
    system=system,
    n_chains=20,
    bead_types=[BeadType("A"), BeadType("B")],
    architecture=arch.comb(backbone=[("A", 100)], side=("B", 5), every=10),
    use_angles=True,
)
```

| Factory | Architecture |
|---|---|
| `arch.linear(seq)` | linear chain (same as `topology="linear"`) |
| `arch.ring(seq)` | cyclic chain |
| `arch.star(center, arms)` | star / miktoarm: center bead + f arms (arms may differ) |
| `arch.comb(backbone, side, every, offset=0)` | regular comb: side chains every `every` backbone beads |
| `arch.graft(backbone, {idx: side_seq, ...})` | graft polymer with explicit graft points |
| `arch.tadpole(ring_seq, tail, attach=0)` | ring + linear tail (lariat) |
| `arch.dendrimer(core, branch, branch_factor, generations)` | regularly branched dendrimer |
| `arch.custom(bead_types, bonds)` | arbitrary graph escape hatch |

Every sequence slot (backbone, arm, side chain, tail) accepts the same
formats as `sequence` — strings, explicit lists, or block tuples. Explicit
monomer-level structure is available through `MonomerTemplate` (multi-bead
monomers with named connection points `head`/`tail`/`side`) and
`BeadArchitecture.from_monomers(...)`.

**Copolymer sequence generators** (usable in any sequence slot):

```python
from AutoPoly import block_sequence, alternating_sequence, random_sequence, gradient_sequence

arch.linear(block_sequence([("A", 50), ("B", 50)]))     # diblock
arch.linear(alternating_sequence(["A", "B"], 100))      # ABAB...
arch.linear(random_sequence(["A", "B"], 100, weights=[0.7, 0.3], seed=42))
arch.linear(gradient_sequence("A", "B", 100, seed=1))   # A→B composition gradient
```

**Branch angles** are configurable: angle triplets centered on branch
points (graft points, star centers — beads with degree > 2) are included
by default and get their own canonical triplets (e.g. side–backbone–side
vs. backbone–backbone–backbone), so they can carry separate `AngleType`
stiffness. Pass `include_branch_angles=False` to exclude them.

**Branched MC equilibration** works out of the box: tree-pivot moves
(rotate the subtree beyond any bridge bond) and segment crankshaft moves
(on linear segments) replace the path-based pivot/crankshaft; reptation
is linear-only and is skipped for branched chains.

## Mixtures (multi-species melts)

`BeadSpringSystem` packs several species — any mix of architectures —
into one box and one data file:

```python
from AutoPoly import BeadSpringSystem, BeadType
from AutoPoly.models import architectures as arch

bss = BeadSpringSystem(
    name="ring_linear_blend",
    system=system,
    bead_types=[BeadType("A")],
    bond_style="fene",
    pair_style="wca",
    density=0.85,
)
bss.add_species(arch.ring([("A", 50)]), n_chains=20)
bss.add_species(arch.linear([("A", 50)]), n_chains=20)
bss.generate()    # moltemplate backend (default)
```

All species share one bead-type table; chains of all species are placed
collision-free with the graph-based SAW generator.

## Mixtures and the moltemplate backend

Mixtures use the same `generate()` entry point and backend selection;
with the default moltemplate backend each chain becomes its own
moltemplate object sharing one bead-type table, so mixed systems
(rings + stars + combs + ...) land in one `system.data`.

## Potentials

- **Bonds** — `"harmonic"` (E = K(r−r₀)²) or `"fene"` (finitely extensible nonlinear elastic, the standard for bead-spring melts)
- **Pairs** — `"lj"` (full Lennard-Jones, cutoff 2.5σ) or `"wca"` (repulsive Weeks–Chandler–Andersen, cutoff ≈ 1.122σ)
- **Angles** — optional per-triplet stiffness via `AngleType`

## Generation methods

| `generation_method` | Speed | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `"geometric"` | Fastest | Simple geometric placement; may contain overlaps |
| `"saw"` (default) | Fast | Self-avoiding walk — overlap-free coils |
| `"mc"` | Slow | Monte Carlo pre-equilibration (`MCConfig`) — relaxed starting configurations |

The SAW generator shares its collision detector with the atomistic [MC placement engine](mc-placement.md); box size comes from the target bead density (default 0.85 beads/σ³). If a chain fails to grow (crowded box, branched architecture), the whole-system generation is retried up to `SAWConfig.system_retries` times (default 3) before falling back to geometric placement; for branched chains at melt density, generate at a moderate density (~0.3–0.4) and compress with NPT.

## Output backends

`generate()` produces LAMMPS files through one of two backends (set the default with the constructor's `backend` parameter, override per call):

| Backend | Call | Output | When to use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `"moltemplate"` (default) | `generate()` | `<out>/<name>/moltemplate/`: `system.data`, `system.in.init`, `system.in.settings`, `in.polymer` + the `.lt` sources (`bead_spring.lt`, `bead_<Type>.lt`, `chains.lt`, `system.lt`) | **Standard.** Same layout as the atomistic pipeline; the `.lt` files are inspectable/editable, and CG chains can be mixed with other moltemplate objects |
| `"direct"` | `generate(backend="direct")` | `<out>/<name>/`: `polymer.data` + `in.polymer` (self-contained, reduced units) | Very large melts where the moltemplate build step is slow |

Both backends consume the same generated coordinates and graph structure — the physics is identical. The lower-level methods `generate_moltemplate(run_moltemplate=...)` and `generate_data_file()` remain available for explicit control.
