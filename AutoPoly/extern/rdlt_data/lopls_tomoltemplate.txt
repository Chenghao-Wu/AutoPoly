* This file attempts to match lopls atom types defined 
* in the loplsaa.lt file based on SMARTS pattern matching
* Not sure how well these are defined. Should we overwrite all "@atom:80" types with "@atom:80L"?
* I have chosen to restrict these to specific domains and leave the standard OPLS in place

* Only source given for these is the LOPLS JCTC 2012, but they aren't defined there. Overwrite OPLS?
